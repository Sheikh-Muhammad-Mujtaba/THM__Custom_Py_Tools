# TryHackMe - Custom Python Tools üõ°Ô∏èüêç

Welcome to my **TryHackMe Custom Python Tools** repository!  
This project is part of my practical cybersecurity learning journey where I build Python-based utilities to assist with scanning, enumeration, and vulnerability testing.

---

## üöÄ About the Project

These tools are **custom-built scripts** to help automate common tasks in cybersecurity practices, especially during CTFs, labs, or real-world testing scenarios.  
Each tool was created to **enhance hands-on learning** and **improve manual testing workflows**.

While currently they are **basic and designed for users who understand Python and cybersecurity principles**, I plan to make them more **user-friendly**, **modular**, and **feature-rich** very soon!

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Included

- **Brute Forcing Scripts**: Automate login attempts on vulnerable pages.
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Basic SQL Injection (SQLi), XSS, and LFI scanners.
- **Automation Helpers**: Quickly perform tasks like payload delivery or parameter testing.

> **Note**: These tools are educational and experimental. Use them responsibly and only on systems you have permission to test.

## üìö How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sheikh-Muhammad-Mujtaba/THM__Custom_Py_Tools.git
   cd THM__Custom_Py_Tools
   ```

2. **Set up the environment**:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
   - Install required packages if needed:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   *(Note: If no `requirements.txt` exists yet.)*

3. **Run a tool**:
   ```bash
   python tool_name.py
   ```

4. **Customize**:
   Feel free to modify the scripts according to your target environment and needs.

## üåü Future Plans

- Add **argument parsing** (`argparse`) to make tools more interactive.
- Implement **error handling** and **logging**.
- Build a **unified toolkit** version (CLI application).
- Expand tools to cover more vulnerabilities (RCE, Directory Traversal, CSRF testing, etc.)
